To develop an Automated Reports Generator using Excel, we'll leverage VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to create a system that meets the specified requirements. Here, I'll provide a simplified version of the code and explain its components using an example and a dataset. Note that a full implementation would require more detailed coding and testing, especially for handling diverse data sources and complex report templates.
Step-by-Step Approach

1. Create an Excel Workbook: The workbook will contain the VBA code, templates, and settings.
2. Write VBA Code: The VBA code will handle data integration, processing, and report generation.
3. Design Templates: Create customizable templates for reports.
4. Configure Scheduling: Use VBA to schedule report generation.
5. Error Handling: Implement error handling in VBA.
6. User Interface: Provide an interface for users to configure settings and generate reports.

Example Dataset
For this example, let's assume we have two datasets:
1. Sales Data (SalesData.xlsx):
   | Date       | Product | Sales |
   |------------|---------|-------|
   | 2023-01-01 | A       | 100   |
   | 2023-01-01 | B       | 150   |
   | 2023-01-02 | A       | 200   |
   | 2023-01-02 | B       | 100   |

2. Inventory Data (InventoryData.xlsx):
   | Date       | Product | Inventory |
   |------------|---------|-----------|
   | 2023-01-01 | A       | 50        |
   | 2023-01-01 | B       | 30        |
   | 2023-01-02 | A       | 45        |
   | 2023-01-02 | B       | 25        |

VBA Code
1. Data Integration and Processing
vba
Sub GenerateReport()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim salesData As Workbook
    Dim inventoryData As Workbook
    Dim report As Workbook
    Dim salesSheet As Worksheet
    Dim inventorySheet As Worksheet
    Dim reportSheet As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long

    ' Open the data workbooks
    Set salesData = Workbooks.Open("C:\path\to\SalesData.xlsx")
    Set inventoryData = Workbooks.Open("C:\path\to\InventoryData.xlsx")

    ' Create a new workbook for the report
    Set report = Workbooks.Add
    Set reportSheet = report.Sheets(1)

    ' Copy Sales Data
    Set salesSheet = salesData.Sheets(1)
    salesSheet.Range("A1:C" & salesSheet.Cells(salesSheet.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row).Copy Destination:=reportSheet.Range("A1")

    ' Copy Inventory Data
    Set inventorySheet = inventoryData.Sheets(1)
    lastRow = reportSheet.Cells(reportSheet.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row + 2
    inventorySheet.Range("A1:C" & inventorySheet.Cells(inventorySheet.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row).Copy Destination:=reportSheet.Range("A" & lastRow)

    ' Close the data workbooks
    salesData.Close False
    inventoryData.Close False

    ' Save the report
    report.SaveAs "C:\path\to\GeneratedReport.xlsx"
    report.Close False

    MsgBox "Report Generated Successfully!"

End Sub

2. Scheduling Report Generation

To schedule the report generation, we'll use Windows Task Scheduler to run an Excel macro at a specified time. Save the above VBA script in a module named GenerateReport and create another subroutine to call it.

vba
Sub ScheduleReportGeneration()
    GenerateReport
End Sub

Save the workbook with the VBA code enabled (e.g., `ReportGenerator.xlsm`), and then use Windows Task Scheduler to open this workbook at the desired time, which will run the `ScheduleReportGeneration` subroutine.

3. Error Handling

Add error handling to ensure the system can handle issues gracefully.

vba
Sub GenerateReport()
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    ' Existing code here...
    Exit Sub
ErrorHandler:
    MsgBox "An error occurred: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
End Sub


Explanation and Example

1. Data Integration: The script opens the `SalesData.xlsx` and `InventoryData.xlsx` workbooks, copies the data into a new report workbook, and saves the report.
2. Customizable Templates: For simplicity, this example directly copies data. In a real scenario, you would format the report using VBA to match your template.
3. Data Processing: The script processes the data by integrating sales and inventory data into one report.
4. Automation and Scheduling: The script is automated using VBA and can be scheduled with Task Scheduler.
5. Error Handling: Basic error handling is added to notify users of any issues.

 Test Plan and Test Cases

1. Test Case 1: Verify that the report generates correctly when data files are present.
2. Test Case 2: Check error handling by providing incorrect file paths.
3. Test Case 3: Test scheduling to ensure the report is generated at the specified time.
4. Test Case 4: Validate the final report format against the predefined template.

User Manual

1. Open Excel Workbook: Open `ReportGenerator.xlsm`.
2. Run Macro: Press `Alt + F8`, select `GenerateReport`, and click `Run`.
3. Schedule Report: Use Task Scheduler to automate report generation by opening `ReportGenerator.xlsm` at the desired time.

This simplified example illustrates the core concepts of an automated report generator in Excel using VBA. A complete implementation would require additional features, robust error handling, and extensive testing to ensure reliability and compliance with organizational standards.
